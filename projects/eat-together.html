            <p>The project, titled Eat Together, was developed to address critical issues faced by the homeless
                community,
                particularly resource wastage, uneven distribution, and the overemphasis on certain resources. These
                inefficiencies often led to an imbalance in how support was provided, leaving some individuals
                underserved
                while others received excess.<br><br>The inspiration behind this initiative came from
                collaborative research with HomeStreetHome Taiwan, which highlighted these gaps in resource management
                and
                distribution. The project aimed to create a more tailored and efficient solution to
                ensure
                that resources reached those in need in a balanced manner. <br><br>By working closely with NGOs, the
                project
                sought to align technological solutions with
                the
                real-world needs of homeless individuals, making the process of receiving and distributing resources
                more
                streamlined and impactful.

            <p>The design of the Eat Together platform was centered on ease of use and accessibility for both NGO
                administrators and the homeless community. The following key design elements were implemented:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Calendar View:</strong> The core feature, developed using FullCalendar.js, displays
                    resources by location, type, and time. Users can easily hover over events to see details such as
                    resource
                    type, quantity, and provider information.</li>

                <li><strong>Map Integration:</strong> The map section uses a carousel view to display street-level
                    images of distribution points, making it easier for users to locate resources. This feature helps
                    avoid logistical challenges and overcrowding at distribution locations.</li>

                <li><strong>Mobile-First Design:</strong> Special attention was given to mobile accessibility, as many
                    users may rely on shared devices or public internet access. The design ensures the platform
                    functions seamlessly across desktops and mobile phones.</li>

                <li><strong>NGO and Public Usability:</strong> The interface was designed to be intuitive for NGO
                    administrators managing resources and public users seeking them, ensuring both groups can
                    efficiently interact with the platform.</li>
            </ul>

        </div>

        <!-- Original Content -->
        <div class="original-content-design">
            <p>The design of the Eat Together platform was developed with a strong focus on usability, accessibility,
                and responsiveness, particularly to accommodate users from both NGO administrators and the general
                public. The platform is divided into distinct sections: the header, calendar, map, and footer, each
                serving a specific function.</p>

                            showcasing
                            the project’s
                            title, slogan, and purpose. The design here is meant to make a strong first impression and
                            convey
                            the
                            project’s core mission of efficient and equitable resource distribution.</li>

                            designed
                            using
                            FullCalendar.js. It displays registered resources based on the time, date, and location of
                            their
                            distribution. Users can hover over events to see detailed information, including resource
                            type,
                            quantity, location, and provider. <br><br>The sidebar lists events by resource category,
                            allowing
                            users
                            to
                            easily identify oversupplied or undersupplied resources. The calendar design incorporates
                            tabs
                            that
                            allow users to switch between different distribution locations. By integrating these
                            features,
                            the
                            calendar section ensures that both distributors and recipients can efficiently manage and
                            access
                            resources.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Map Section:</strong> The map displays distribution locations with both map and
                            street
                            views
                            using a carousel.
                            This is particularly useful for both distributors and the homeless community, as it helps
                            them
                            navigate
                            to the correct locations. This section minimizes confusion and logistical issues like

                            incorrect distribution points, and resource mismanagement. The top three gathering locations

                            chosen
                            based on where the homeless community most frequently resides, ensuring that resource

        <!-- Original Content -->
        <p>The project was implemented using a full-stack approach, focusing on scalability and operational
            effectiveness for both NGO administrators and public users in real-world environments. The development
            process was independently led from start to finish, including pitching the concept to NGOs, designing the
            system’s architecture, coding, testing, and final deployment.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Front-End:</strong> Vue.js was selected for its flexibility, ease of integration, and reactive
                capabilities, allowing for a seamless and responsive user experience. This framework was critical in
                ensuring that users, from NGOs to the general public, could navigate the platform effortlessly across
                devices.</li>

            <li><strong>Back-End:</strong> Firebase was chosen for hosting and database management due to its smooth
                integration with Vue.js and its ability to scale alongside the platform’s growing user base. Firebase
                provided a reliable back-end solution without requiring complex server management.</li>

            </ul>
            <p> These features were delayed due to the city government's involvement, which expanded the project’s
                scope. Ongoing research and feedback will shape their integration, further enhancing the platform’s

            <p>As the "Eat Together" project continues to evolve, we have identified two key features for future
                implementation, set to be introduced in Phase 2:<br></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Demand Registry for the Homeless Community:</strong> Alongside the current resource registry
                    form for
                    distributors, a new form will allow the homeless community to communicate their specific needs
                    directly. This "demand registry" will be visible in a sidebar, providing an intuitive snapshot of
                    the most urgent resources required by the community. By clearly displaying the needs of the
                    homeless, we aim to foster a more efficient and balanced distribution system that responds directly
                    to these demands.</li>
                <li><strong>Location Pinning for Street Services:</strong> To improve street medical care and social
                    services, Phase 2
                    will introduce a feature allowing the homeless community to pin their locations on the map. This
                    will facilitate follow-up medical treatments, ongoing social support, and outreach programs. The
                    feature will be voluntary, ensuring privacy while enabling social care providers to better target
                    their efforts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These features were initially postponed due to the expanded project scope following the city
                government’s
                involvement, which has broadened the platform’s potential impact. Discussions are ongoing to align the
                platform with the government’s objectives. Meanwhile, field research and user feedback will guide the
                integration of these features into the existing system. While Phase 1 established a strong foundation,
                Phase 2 will further enhance the platform’s community-focused and personalized impact.

        <p>Eat Together has garnered attention from local governmental bodies,
            including the Taichung City Government and the Social Affairs Bureau. These discussions have highlighted the
            platform’s potential not only to address immediate challenges but also to shape public policy and urban
            management by optimizing resource distribution processes.</p>
        <p>As the platform moves into Phase 2, it remains flexible and scalable, poised to deepen its impact through
            enhanced communication between the homeless community and service providers. By building on the strong
            foundation established in Phase 1, Eat Together is well-positioned to drive meaningful change in both
            resource management and public welfare, ensuring continued support for the more vulnerable populations.</p>
